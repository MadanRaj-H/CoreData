# CoreData
Explore how CoreData is implements in iOS10 

iOS 10 brings some welcome improvements to Core Data, including the all new NSPersistentContainer class.The main purpose of NSPersistentContainer is to simplify the process of setting up Core Data stacks and provide some useful utils for our daily usage.

This app is all about contacts where we will basically perform following operations
  
  * Add a person to contact
  * Delete a person contact
  * Update a person contact

By using CoreData, the data stored is persistent and it will be easy to filter your person contacts also.
Filter process can happen by the type of person u store it (Family,Friends,Employee)
